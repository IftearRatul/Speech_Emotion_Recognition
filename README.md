The **speech-emotion-recognition.ipynb** notebook implements a speech emotion recognition system using machine learning techniques. I have build a **LSTM neural network** to build a classifier. It uses libraries like librosa for audio feature extraction, scikit-learn for model training, and matplotlib for visualization. The system classifies audio files into emotional categories such as happy, sad, fear, disgust, angry, and neutral.
